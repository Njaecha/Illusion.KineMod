# KineMod
A simple plugin meant mostly for us IK users who have noticed there's a painful lack of control over certain body parts that FK has.

- IK can now work with FK.
- Toggle individual FK bones such as clavicle, toes, etc,.
- Easy to use control over the IK effectors.

# Why
Originally this all started as a mere attempt at making the clavicle FK bones usable with IK. In trying to do so, I discovered the effectors, the way FK causes IK to be ignored, and other FK bones we IK users are missing out on, particularly toes. I decided I would give this control back to the user.

# Installation
Grab the corresponding DLL for your game in the releases and place it into Bepinex/plugins
